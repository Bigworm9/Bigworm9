# 👋 Hi, I'm J. Ferren Patton (Juan)

🚀 **AWS Cloud Architect | Cloud Engineer | DevOps-Inspired Builder**

I design secure, reliable, and scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS. My focus is building real-world architecture that aligns with business goals — whether it's serverless APIs, CI/CD pipelines, or infrastructure automation. I take pride in delivering solutions that are secure by design and production-ready.
